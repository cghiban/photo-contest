		  <p style="font-size: 1.3rem; margin-top:30px;">We invite you to submit your best portraits to <em>All the World in New York City</em>, which explores the racial and cultural diversity of  America's immigrant city. Photographs should tell a story or reflect the heritage of  New Yorkers with origins from another part of the world. </p>
		  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">Selected photographs will be displayed at <em>DNA Learning Center NYC</em>, on the campus of the New York City College of Technology in downtown Brooklyn. They will become part of a permanent exhibition, <em>What DNA Says about Our Past and Future</em>. The portraits of New Yorkers will illustrate migrations that have mixed people and their DNA throughout history.</p>
			<p style="font-size: 1.1rem;"><strong>Photographs</strong> and <strong>subject biographies</strong> will be judged &ldquo;blind,&rdquo;  without submitter&rsquo;s name. The judging panel will be chaired by Jeanne  Moutoussamy-Ashe, a celebrated photographer and public health advocate. The photographers of the top 40 photographs will each receive a<em> $500 award.</em></p>
		  <p style="font-size: 1.1rem;">There is <strong>no entry fee</strong>. A maximum of three photos may be submitted per photographer. Entries are welcome from anyone age 18 and older. </p>
