				Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory has opened a new science center, <em>DNA Learning Center NYC</em>, on the campus of the New York City College of Technology in Downtown Brooklyn. Biology lab experiences offered at the center help students and the public see themselves as scientists. </p>
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem;" align="right"><em>What DNA Says About Our Past and Future</em>, a permanent museum exhibition under development, will present a hopeful message of genetics in our lives. The DNA of any two people is 99.9% identical; racial and ethnic differences acquired as we peopled the globe are, indeed, only “skin deep.”</p>
<p style="font-size: 1.25rem;" align="right">A gallery within the exhibition—<em>All the World in New York City</em>—will feature photographs of the many races, cultures, and ethnicities represented by the people living today in New York, America’s traditional immigrant city. All of these people are closely related by their common DNA past.
